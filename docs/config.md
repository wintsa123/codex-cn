# Configuration

For basic configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

For advanced configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced).

## Custom model providers

You can define custom providers in `~/.codex/config.toml` and select them via `model_provider`.

Example Anthropic provider:

```toml
[model_providers.anthropic]
name = "Anthropic"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com"
env_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
wire_api = "anthropic"

model_provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
```

You can also set provider overrides inside agent role config files (for example `~/.codex/agents/researcher.toml`):

```toml
model_provider = "anthropic"

[model_providers.anthropic]
name = "Anthropic"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com"
env_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
wire_api = "anthropic"
```

Before running Codex, set your key in the environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
```

## Connecting to MCP servers

Codex can connect to MCP servers configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`. See the configuration reference for the latest MCP server options:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

## Apps (Connectors)

Use `$` in the composer to insert a ChatGPT connector; the popover lists accessible
apps. The `/apps` command lists available and installed apps. Connected apps appear first
and are labeled as connected; others are marked as can be installed.

## Hooks

Codex can run hooks at lifecycle boundaries such as `session_start`, `session_end`, `user_prompt_submit`, `pre_tool_use`, `permission_request`, `notification`, `post_tool_use`, `post_tool_use_failure`, `stop`, `subagent_start`, `subagent_stop`, `teammate_idle`, `task_completed`, `config_change` (currently emitted for skills file changes; source is "skills"), `pre_compact`, `worktree_create`, and `worktree_remove`.

Example:

```toml
[hooks]

[[hooks.pre_tool_use]]
command = ["python3", "/Users/me/.codex/hooks/check_tool.py"]
timeout = 5
once = true

[hooks.pre_tool_use.matcher]
tool_name_regex = "^(shell|exec)$"
```

Hooks receive a JSON payload on `stdin`. If the hook exits with code `0`, Codex will attempt to parse a JSON object from `stdout` (either the full output or the first parseable JSON line). Exit code `2` blocks execution for hook events that support blocking; other non-zero exit codes are treated as non-blocking errors. All matching hooks run in parallel and identical handlers are deduplicated.

`command` can be either an argv list (`["python3", "..."]`) or a shell command string (`"python3 ..."`). Matchers can filter by `matcher`, and tool events can also filter by `tool_name` / `tool_name_regex`.

See `docs/hooks.md` for hook payload fields and `stdout` response options.

Project hooks can also be configured in `./.codex/config.toml`. If the project directory is untrusted, project layers may load as disabled; mark it trusted via your user config (for example, `[projects."/abs/path"].trust_level = "trusted"`).

See the configuration reference for the latest hook settings:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

When Codex knows which client started the turn, the legacy notify JSON payload also includes a top-level `client` field. The TUI reports `codex-tui`, and the app server reports the `clientInfo.name` value from `initialize`.

## Scheduled tasks

Scheduled-task tools and the TUI `/loop` shortcut are enabled by default. To keep `/loop` available, leave `disable_cron` unset or set it to `false` in `config.toml`:

```toml
disable_cron = false
```

To disable `/loop` and the scheduled-task tools globally:

```toml
disable_cron = true
```

You can also override the setting per profile. The active profile wins over the root setting:

```toml
disable_cron = true
profile = "scheduled"

[profiles.scheduled]
disable_cron = false
```

## GitHub webhook

`codex github` can load non-sensitive webhook defaults from the top-level `[github_webhook]` table in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
Secrets stay in environment variables; the config only stores env var names and runtime defaults.

Example:

```toml
[github_webhook]
enabled = true
listen = "127.0.0.1:8787"
webhook_secret_env = "GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
github_token_env = "GITHUB_TOKEN"
github_app_id_env = "GITHUB_APP_ID"
github_app_private_key_env = "GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY"
auth_mode = "auto"
min_permission = "read"
allow_repos = ["owner/repo"]
command_prefix = "/codex"
delivery_ttl_days = 7
repo_ttl_days = 0
sources = ["repo", "organization", "github-app"]

[github_webhook.events]
issue_comment = true
issues = true
pull_request = true
pull_request_review = true
pull_request_review_comment = true
push = true
```

Notes:

- CLI flags still override config defaults.
- If `[github_webhook]` is absent, `codex github` keeps the legacy event surface (`issue_comment`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`).
- `issues`, `pull_request`, and `push` only trigger when the issue body, PR body, or head commit message explicitly starts with the configured command prefix.
- `auth_mode = "auto"` prefers GitHub App installation tokens when available and falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## JSON Schema

The generated JSON Schema for `config.toml` lives at `codex-rs/core/config.schema.json`.

## SQLite State DB

Codex stores the SQLite-backed state DB under `sqlite_home` (config key) or the
`CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` environment variable. When unset, it defaults to `CODEX_HOME`.

## Notices

Codex stores "do not show again" flags for some UI prompts under the `[notice]` table.

## Plan mode defaults

`plan_mode_reasoning_effort` lets you set a Plan-mode-specific default reasoning
effort override. When unset, Plan mode uses the built-in Plan preset default
(currently `medium`). When explicitly set (including `none`), it overrides the
Plan preset. The string value `none` means "no reasoning" (an explicit Plan
override), not "inherit the global default". There is currently no separate
config value for "follow the global default in Plan mode".

Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D quitting uses a ~1 second double-press hint (`ctrl + c again to quit`).
